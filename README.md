# LIGHT

### Why:

We're not trying to reinvent the wheel... This is more meant to be a proof of concept and integrated package management suite for *our* programs. We won't force anyone to use it. We want to have the ability to expand and grow in our own way.

---

### Planned Features:

* [ ] Template for integrating packages into the LIGHT repositories.
* [ ] Home/Default repository with a RESTful API.
* [ ] Easy versioning scheme with both binary *and* source support.
* [ ] Front end program `light` with support for a good amount of systems.
* [ ] Caching of packages (binary only).
* [ ] Debug logging.
